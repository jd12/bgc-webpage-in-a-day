## Web Design Steps

#### Determine the intended Audience
- The colors, images, and layout should be tailored to the preferences of your audience. The type of site content (reading level, amount of animation, etc.) should be appropriate for your chosen audience.
#### Determine the Goals of the Site
- Some common goals of web sites are: to be informative, to create a personal home page, to establish a corporate web presence, and to do business in e-commerce.
#### Determine  the General Content and Create a Site Map
- The Site Map is sometimes called a Storyboard. Common organizational structures for Web sites are: hierarchical, linear, and random.
#### Sketch a Tentative Layout Page
- Be consistent in your overall layout- color, typefaces, logo location, navigation bar, etc. Plan your Home Page Layout to avoid scrolling. Plan your Content Page Layout to be consistent, with easy navigation.

## Part One: Start Project in Glitch

1. Open [this link](https://glitch.com/~jd12-bgc-webpage-in-a-day) 

2. Sign in to Glitch so that you can save your progress.

3. Click `Remix this Project` 

4. Open the `index.html`. It should look like this.

5. Test the website by adding your name to the `div` section.

6. See your page by clicking on Show in the top toolbar.

## Part Two: Start Building Website

1. Modify the title of the web page [the text that appears in the tab] by changing the text between the `<title>` and `</title>` tags to `Trillium Media Design` like so: 
![Title](images/title.png)

2. Position your cursor in the body section and code the header element with the text, "Trillium Media Design" in an h1 element element like so: <br>
![Header](images/header.png)

3. Code a nav element to contain text that will indicate the main navigation for the website. Configure bold text using the b element and use the `&nbsp` special character (which stands for Nonbreaking space) to add extra blank space like so: <br>
![Nav Bar](images/nav.png)

4. Code the content within a div element that contains the h2 and paragraph elements.

## Part Three: Create Multiple Pages

Many websites have multiple websites associated with it. We are going to create multiple websites associated with our website and link them. 

1. The navigation hyperlinks will be located within the nav element. You will edit the code within the nav element to configure three hyperlinks. 
  - The text "Home" will hyperlink to index.html
  - The text "Services" will hyperlink to services.html
  - The text "Contact" will hyperlink to contact.html
  
  Modify the code within the nav element as follows:
  ![Nav](images/navLinks.png)
  
2. Create a new file by clicking the three dots next to `index.html` and selecting `Duplicate`
   - Rename it to services.html. Your folder structure should look like so: 
   ![Services Initial](images/servicesInitial.png)
   
   - Modify the title of the web page by changing the text between the `<title>` and `</title>` tags to "Trillium Media Design - Services":
   ![Service Title](images/servicesTitle.png)
   
   - Delete the code and text between the opening and closing div tags and replace it with: 
   ![Service Content](images/servicesContent.png)
   
   - Your page should look like this: 
   ![Services Final](images/servicesFinal.png)
   
3. Create the Contact Page by clicking the three dots next to `services.html` and selecting `Duplicate` 
  - Rename it to contact.html and click OK
  
  - Modify the title to "Trillium Media Design - Contact" 
  
  - Delete the code between the opening and closing div tag and replace it with: 
  ![Contact Content](images/contactContent.png)
  
  - Your page should look like this:
  ![Contact Final](images/contactFinal.png)
